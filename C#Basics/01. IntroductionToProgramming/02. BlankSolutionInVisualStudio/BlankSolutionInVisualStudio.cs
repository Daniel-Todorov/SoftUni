//Create a blank solution in Visual Studio called “Intro-Programming-Homework”. 
//This solution will hold all your homework projects, code and files. 
//For each problem (exercises) add a separate project with self-descriptive name like “Hello-World” and “Print-Your-Name”. 
//You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem.

//                     !!!NOTE!!!
//I've chosen another naming style which allows easier access to the homework.
//The names of the project always start with their number with a leading zero folowed by the problem name as it is in the homework sheet.
//The name of the application inside the project has no numbering and it follows the name requested by the homework project.
