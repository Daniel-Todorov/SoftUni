//Write a program that counts how many times a given word occurs in given text. 
//The first line in the input holds the word. 
//The second line of the input holds the text. 
//The output should be a single integer number – the number of word occurrences. 
//Matching should be case-insensitive. 
//Note that not all matching substrings are words and should be counted. 
//A word is a sequence of letters separated by punctuation or start / end of text.
