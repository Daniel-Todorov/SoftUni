//Write a program that calculates the perimeter and the area of given polygon (not necessarily convex) consisting of n floating-point coordinates in the 2D plane. 
//Print the result rounded to two decimal digits after the decimal point. Use the input and output format from the examples. 
//To hold the points, define a class Point(x, y). 
//To hold the polygon use a Polygon class which holds a list of points. 
//Find in Internet how to calculate the polygon perimeter and how to calculate the area of a polygon.
